#Doodle-V3

This is an updated version of Doodle. Continued from DoodleV2.

Added features:
```
-Single page design with a multi-page UI using Path.JS
-Has a start page
-Uses Imgur API to call up popular images
-Can point to any image on the web instead of just local images
-Used Parse to keep a record of images that have been uploaded through Doodle! and shows recent uploads.
```
The drawing interface remains the same.
